# Install Pragma

> Pragma is currently under heavy development, and should not be used in a production setting. All Pragma APIs are subject to breaking change.

## Linux

### Requirements
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

To make sure you have them and that they work, run:
```sh
docker run hello-world
```
```sh
docker-compose --help
```

If any of the above commands fail, make sure it works before proceeding with the installation of Pragma.

### Installation

Now to install Pragma, run:
```sh
sudo curl https://pragmalang.github.io/pragma/install/linux/install.sh | sh
```

This script will download the Pragma binary, change it to become executable, and place it in `/usr/local/bin`. It also places a `pragma-docker-compose.yml` file in `/usr/local/bin`, and runs it.

### Run Pragma

Once Pragma is downloaded and installed, you can see if it works by running the following command:
```
pragma help
```

## macOS

### Requirements

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
- [Java](https://java.com/en/download/help/linux_install.html)

### Installation

First, we need to install the Pragma CLI:

- [Download the Pragma DMG file (`pragma.dmg`)](https://github.com/pragmalang/pragma/releases/download/v0.1.0/pragma.dmg)
- Run `pragma.dmg`

After the CLI is installed, we need to install and run the Pragma Daemon (`pragmad`): 

- Create a `docker-compose.yml` file with the contents of [this docker-compose file](https://github.com/pragmalang/pragma/blob/master/cli/src/main/resources/docker-compose.yml)
- Run it with `docker-compose up -d`

> *Note*: The name of the docker-compose file *must* be `docker-compose.yml`, and you must run `docker-compose up -d` from the directory where you created the `docker-compose.yml` file.

### Run Pragma

Once Pragma is downloaded and installed, you can see if it works by running the following command from the terminal:
```
pragma help
```

## Windows

### Requirements

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
- [Java](https://java.com/en/download/help/linux_install.html)

### Installation

First, we need to install the Pragma CLI:

- [Download the installer (`pragma.msi`)](https://github.com/pragmalang/pragma/releases/download/v0.1.0/pragma.msi)
- Run `pragma.msi` and follow the installation wizard

> *Note*: If Microsoft Defender tells you it prevented an unrecognized app from starting, click on "__More info__", then click on **"Run anyway"**.

After the CLI is installed, we need to install and run the Pragma Daemon (`pragmad`): 

- Create a `docker-compose.yml` file with the contents of [this docker-compose file](https://github.com/pragmalang/pragma/blob/master/cli/src/main/resources/docker-compose.yml)
- Run it with `docker-compose up -d`


> *Note*: The name of the docker-compose file *must* be `docker-compose.yml`, and you must run `docker-compose up -d` from the folder where you created the `docker-compose.yml` file.

### Run Pragma

Once Pragma is downloaded and installed, you can see if it works by running the following command from PowerShell:
```
pragma help
```

# Contributing

Pragma is a Scala 2.13 project built using SBT. It's divided into three subprojects:
* `core`: where the domain abstractions and parsing logic is kept alongside any shared logic between other subprojects. All other subprojects depend on the `core`.
* `daemon`: where the serving and project management logic lives. It needs instances for Postgres and Openwhisk to be running; it's meant to be running alongside them in the background while using Pragma during development and in production.
* `cli`: where the communication with the `daemon` and the loading of user files is done.

It's highly recommended to be familiar with [Cats](https://typelevel.org/cats/) and [Cats Effect](https://typelevel.org/cats-effect/) before starting to work on the daemon. 

## Setup
Pragma has been developed using VSCode with the Metals extension on Linux. For it all to work, it requires a JDK, Scala, SBT, and Ammonite for some scripts. Use this script to quickly install them:
```sh
curl -Lo cs https://git.io/coursier-cli-linux && chmod +x cs && ./cs setup
```
Docker and Docker Compose are also used for conveniently running Postgres and Openwhisk locally.

## Testing
The recommended way to work on the daemon is to run it using SBT and run Postgres and Openwhisk from `docker-compose`.

To run Postgres and Openwhisk:
```sh
cd daemon/src/main/resources/ && docker-compose up
```
> Make sure to run this before running `sbt 'daemon/test'`.

Running the daemon using `sbt 'daemon/run'` requires the following environment variables to be exported:
```sh
export DAEMON_HOSTNAME=localhost && \
export DAEMON_PORT=9584 && \
export DAEMON_PG_HOST='localhost' && \
export DAEMON_PG_PORT=5433 && \
export DAEMON_PG_DB_NAME='test' && \
export DAEMON_PG_USER='test'  && \
export DAEMON_WSK_API_URL='http://localhost:3233'  && \
export DAEMON_WSK_AUTH_TOKEN='23bc46b1-71f6-4ed5-8c54-816aa4f8c502:123zO3xZCLrMN6v2BKK1dXYFpXlPkccOFqm12CdAsMgRU4VrNZ9lyGVCGuMDGIwP'  && \
export DAEMON_PG_PASSWORD='test'  && \
export DAEMON_WSK_API_VERSION=1
```

You can run the daemon alongside Postgres and Openwhisk with:
```sh
# In the root of the project
docker-compose up
```

> NOTE: If the docker containers cannot be started it's most likely because the port 5433 is already in use. Run `docker ps` and then run `docker kill <postgres-containe-id>` to kill the postgres container to fix it.

## Docker Build
Docker builds are performed using [SBT Native Packager](https://www.scala-sbt.org/sbt-native-packager/formats/docker.html). To build the Pragma daemon Docker image:
```
sbt "daemon/docker:publishLocal"
```

## GraalVM Native Image Generation
The native image build is performed using [SBT Native Packager](https://www.scala-sbt.org/sbt-native-packager/formats/graalvm-native-image.html), so the `native-image` version needs to be installed locally.

Currently, only the CLI can be compiled to a native image. Run:
```sh
sbt "cli/graalvm-native-image:packageBin"
```

To generate META-INF (for trying to generate a native image from the daemon):
```
java -agentlib:native-image-agent=config-merge-dir="./src/main/resources/META-INF/native-image/",config-write-initial-delay-secs=0 -jar "./target/scala-2.13/<jarfile>" <arguments-for-jar>
```

* https://noelwelsh.com/posts/2020-02-06-serverless-scala-services.html

> NOTE: Make sure everything else other than this process is canceled. It needs all the memory it can get.

## Apache Bench benchmark
Run the ammonite script in `test/benchmark`:
```
amm PragmaBench.sc
```
Make sure the daemon is running before running the benchmark (run `docker-compose up` in the root of the project).

> NOTE: Apache Bench must be installed:
>```
>sudo apt install apache2-utils
>```
